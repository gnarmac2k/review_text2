1937 first animated feature kept telling 1995 witnessing something equally historically important knows maybe four historic films alluded jazz singer flowers trees becky sharp snow white seven dwarfs last claim classic toy story great claim either retrospect nothing new another instance hollywood current infatuation images pleasant light computer animation really soulless device although found enjoyable soulless movie begin animation quite ripe toys suppose easy animate children start look also made plastic whole world seems made plastic eye longs vain something perhaps including children mistake hans andersen toy story story concerned toys toys would fun moving film betrays starts think children two central characters bad toys horribly gimmicky devices children sensibly lose interest sensibly getting parents buy worthless gimcrack woody gave speech important really servicing child dreams wishes whatnot anyone really fall would much honest said every toy kids sorry sound overly critical said liked least slightly sour taste strong enough ruin film john lasseter deserves credit taking formulaic buddy tale breathing genuine life credit medium unyielding computer animation toy story pleasant fun frankly every single traditionally animated film disney made 1989 possible exception hunchback notre dame better sorry close carp randy newman really break song often enough write score without croaking songs hearing success toy story series rented dvd collection toy story 1 toy story 2 monsters loved monsters toy story 2 enjoy toy story 1 even much points like movie 1 starting andy shown playing toys starts get bit annoying keeps playing love toys throughout film bugged find boring even cousin great fan spiderman keeps buying playing 2 animation looked bit faded movie pay much attention towards giving excuse made 1995 compared finding nemo new movies animation would bit 3 sorry tom hanks found character quite annoying film kept screaming like mad character like 4 woody

good groundbreaking computer animation graphics movie delivers reach higher level due animation warmth drawing style classic disney computer style promising quite story good solid start new trend animation good voice fans kids movies afraid really hold well hear much great wit comes short fits good lines know toys characters toy story largely suffer sort juno little miss sunshine lot suffer basically really quirky toys talking facing acts villainy committing acts heroism hour half animation impressive considering made unlike animation old disney films dated noticeably often looking like video game cutscene voice work fine nothing truly interesting world characters pleasant enough movie occasionally fun overwhelming affection seems result nostalgia memory rather lasting value compared adventure incredibles melancholy tone sophisticated ideas sense longing loss adventure toy story falls short short fact much rather take nostalgia cars good starting point pixar nothing even remotely
